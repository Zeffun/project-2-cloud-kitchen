# Cloud Kitchen

App name: Cloud Kitchen.
- This app allows you to query a free external recipes API (https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/), search for recipes by keyword and save recipes that you like to your own cookbook. You can also create and upload your own recipes to save to the Airtable database

- Click on "My Recipes" to access your own personal cookbook, which shows the recipes you have saved/created
- Click on "Create Recipe" to create your own recipe, giving it a name, imageURL, category, cuisine and instructions, then click "add" to upload your new recipe
